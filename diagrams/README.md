|[**State Diagram: "CrytoGlyph State Diagram.pdf"**](https://github.com/OwenKamp/CS151-CryptoGlyph/blob/main/diagrams/CryptoGlyph%20State%20Diagram.pdf) | 
|This state diagram shows the process the program goes through when the user is interacting with it. There are two types of encryption algorithms thatreceive input and based on whether or not the proper input is placed to complete the computation, it will continue or go backwards.|
|[**Class Diagram: "CryptoGlyph UML Diagram.html"**](https://github.com/OwenKamp/CS151-CryptoGlyph/blob/main/diagrams/CryptoGlyph%20UML%20Diagram.html) |
|The class diagram shows the relationships that exist between the different classes of cryptography. We employed the use of multilevel inheritance in this project. We also created utility classes which are used by some of the cryptographic algorithms. |
|[**Use Case Diagram: "Use Case Diagram.pdf"**](https://github.com/OwenKamp/CS151-CryptoGlyph/blob/main/diagrams/Use%20Case%20Diagram.pdf)      |
|This use case diagram shows at a high level how the users interact with the program. The user interacts with the gui and a developer interacts with the methods that are public to them to decrypt and encrypt using different algorithms.|
|[**Timing Diagram: "timing diagram.pdf"**](https://github.com/OwenKamp/CS151-CryptoGlyph/blob/main/diagrams/timing%20diagram.pdf)|
|This timing diagram shows the flow of components interacted with by the user. What order the user goes in to achieve the desired computation of encryption.|
